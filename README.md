# orbit
This is just a very very simple (also very very shitty code) simulation of a 2d body orbiting around another one.
This was made to prove my teacher wrong (kinda)

## How to use
Just download the file `index.html` and open it (with a browser, I only tested it with chrome but it should work no matter what)
